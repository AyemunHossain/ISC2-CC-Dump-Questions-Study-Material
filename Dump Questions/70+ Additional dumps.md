answer is B.

9. You are asked to perform a risk assessment of an information system
for the purpose of recommending the most appropriate security
controls. You have a short amount of time to do this. You have
information about how each asset in the system is used and its
importance to the business, but you have no financial information
about the assets or the information systems. Which is the most
appropriate method to use for this assessment?
A. Qualitative
B. Threat modeling
C. Quantitative
D. Delphi

ANS: A. Since you have no financial data, a quantitative assessment is not
possible, but since you have information about how each asset in the
system is used and its importance to the business, you have what you
need to do a qualitative analysis.
